# ImSad-Sample
<b>App description:</b><br>
ImSad is a feel good app, created to bring a smile to a stranger across the globe by sending them a funny animated gift. 
<ul>
<li><i>My role in the project:</i></li>
<li>As the sole developer on the app, I’ve setup the back end on AWS and coded ImSad in Objective-C.</li>
<li>The app runs on AWS, which was was chosen for its scalability. I’ve implemented DynamoDB database, S3 storage, SNS push notifications and Lambda services to support the project.</li>
<li>A lot of care and attention went into making each interaction delightful with animations and sounds.</li>
<li>Implemented in-app purchases, Google ads and Firebase analytics.</li>
<li>Also implemented MapKit, CoreLocation and AVFoundation frameworks among others.</li>
<li>Made some of the app's features dynamic by passing them through a JSON file hosted on the server.</li>
<li>Created signing identities, provisioning profiles and certificates for the App Store submissions process and shipped the app.</li>
</ul>
<p>
Look for the ImSad App in the Apple App Store!
